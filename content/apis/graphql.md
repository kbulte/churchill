GraphQL has redefined how developers work with APIs and client-server interactions, in 2018 the GraphQL foundation (https://landscape.graphql.org) was founded and is part of the cloud native foundation.

At the time of writing "GraphQL will do to REST what JSON did to XML" is said often.

Of course there are a whole set of API technologies resource, hypermedia and rpc based.
- SOAP
- gRPC
- JSON-RPC
- Apache thrift
- JSON-LD (REST hypermedia)
- HAL (REST hypermedia)
- ODATA (REST query format)
- Vulcain
- Twirp

How do these compare to GraphQL?
