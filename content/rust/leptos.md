# What is leptos

Leptos is a full-stack framework for building web applications in Rust. You can use it to build

- single-page apps (SPAs) rendered entirely in the browser, using client-side routing and loading or mutating data via async requests to the server
- multi-page apps (MPAs) rendered on the server, managing navigation, data, and mutations via web-standard <a> and <form> tags
- progressively-enhanced multi-page apps (PEMPAs?) that are rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client, enhancing your <a> and <form> navigations and mutations seamlessly when WASM is available.
