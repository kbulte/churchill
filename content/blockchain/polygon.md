If you are tired of the Ethereum gas fees you can use polygon, a layer 2 sidechain for ethereum. This is a sidechain which is faster and cheaper than ethereum.
Previously known as 'Matic'. 

Sidechains are less secure because they are not backed by so many resources as a main chain. A bridge is used between ethereum mainnet and the sidechain net to lock and transfere resources from one blockchain to the other.

When to use ethereum main net vs polygon?

- High value transaction you want this extra security of the main chain
- Low value transactions use polygon
- Small or higher frequency of transactions use polygon

Needed to develop on a side chain like polygon:
- A polygon node
- EVM compatible dev tooling like truffle, hardhat or remix
